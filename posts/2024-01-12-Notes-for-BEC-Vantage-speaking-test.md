### Background Reading

#### The difference between a work group and a real team

The distinctions between a team and a work group are very important because the operating level of a group effects:
1. the ability of groups of people to contribute to their organization
2. the levels of personal growth and satisfaction of group members
3. the return on resources (time, talent, money, etc.) expanded by the group
4. the requirements for operating, growing and maintaining the group

#### The difference between a work group and a real team

Fundamental factors that distinguish between work groups and real teams are the presence or absence of:

1. an incremental performance need or opportunity
2. true interdependence and
3. real shared accountability

The best single criterion to use for determining whether a team or work group is the best choice for a given situation is this:
Does an incremental performance need or opportunity exist?
Put another way, is there a need / opportunity to make a significant difference in organizational performance?
It is important to select the right kind of group, either work group or team, for each situation.
One it not inherently better than the other.
If a significant performance need or opportunity exists, then a team is potentially a better choice.
If it does not, then a work group is preferable.
Teams have greater performance potential, but require more development and maintenance than work groups.
It comes down to an issue of return on investment.
Remember also that return is measured not only in dollars, but in quality of work life and other intangibles which will ultimately, though not always immediately, effect the bottom line.

Examples of situations where real teams are needed are sports teams or emergency room trauma teams.
For both of these, there is a key performance need or opportunity, true interdependency and shared accountability.
If they are not functioning as real teams, the result is disaster.

Examples of situations where you often find work groups are a functional department in an organization, or clerks in a department store, or waiters in a restaurant.
In each one of these groups there can be similar individual objectives, but a lack of any small group common objective.
There is some form of coordination or collaboration, but not usually shared accountability or interdependency.
In each of these work group examples, if a significant performance need or opportunity existed, then it would be worthwhile to explore the choice to become a real team with a common group objective, shared accountability, true interdependency and other real team attributes.

The decision whether to become a real team or a work group should be made based on the advantages obtained versus the investment required.
